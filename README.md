TimeTodo
========

Personal Organization App

This app is meant to act as a ToDo list for users or as a means to be productive with their time.

For example, if a user misses their train and the next one doesn't leave for 30 minutes.  
Users can enter 30 minutes into the app and be presented with tasks they can accomplish within that amount of time.

If you click "I'm Hungry" it will show you places you can walk to and from and eat at within the specified time.  

It also allows customized tasks.

Still in Beta.
